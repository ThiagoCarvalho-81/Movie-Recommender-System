# SINCERE - A Movie-Recommender-System 

This repository contains the final assignment of Infnet's Data Science Bootcamp (MIT - Data Science, Data Analytics & Machine Learning).

In a nutshell: After researching scientific articles and market references, a collaborative film recommendation system was developed using Kmeans, Fuzzy C-Means and SVD. This experimental recommendation system was named Sincere and outlined promising results in attacking data sparsity and bursting the bubble of traditional recommendation systems  

This final work was done in pairs. Renan(@renanbdr)and I have worked together on this project. 
The scope of the assignment was, in a period of 2 weeks, to generate an experiment differentiated recommendation system using 3 algorithms.

The files of this repository are divided in the following folders:

Readme
--> Links to the bibliographic references 
--> SIPOC diagram of the entire work
--> Final presentation (available in English and Portuguese)

Datasets
--> Inputs - primary and secondary databases used as input for the analysis.
--> Outputs - intermediate and final results of each stage of the process. Considering the large size of the databases, intermediate files were generated so that whoever wants to reproduce the analysis will not have impacts associated to the computational capacity.
