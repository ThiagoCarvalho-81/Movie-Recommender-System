# SINCERE 
## A less biased experimental hybrid movie recommendation system based on ratings 
Final assignment of Infnet's Data Science Bootcamp (MIT - Data Science, Data Analytics & Machine Learning).

**In a nutshell**: an experimental collaborative movie recommendation system developed on pyhton using Kmeans, Fuzzy C-Means and SVD. The recommendation system was named Sincere and outlined promising results in **attacking data sparsity by bursting the bubble of traditional recommendation systems**.

This is a final bootcamp work, implemented in pairs. Renan([@renanbdr](https://github.com/renanbdr)) and I worked together. 
The scope of the work was, in a 2-week period, to generate a differentiated experimental recommender system using a public dataset and at least 3 algorithms.
