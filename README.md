# SINCERE 
## A less biased experimental hybrid movie recommendation system based on ratings 
Final assignment of Infnet's Data Science Bootcamp (MIT - Data Science, Data Analytics & Machine Learning).

**In a nutshell**: an experimental collaborative movie recommendation system developed on pyhton using Kmeans, Fuzzy C-Means and SVD. The recommendation system was named Sincere and outlined promising results in **attacking data sparsity by bursting the bubble of traditional recommendation systems**.  

The files of this repository are divided in the following folders:

### Readme
* Links to the bibliographic references 
* SIPOC diagram of the entire work
* Final presentation (available in English and Portuguese)

### Datasets
* Inputs - primary and secondary databases used as input for the analysis.
* Outputs - intermediate and final results of each stage of the process. Considering the large size of the databases, intermediate files were generated so that whoever wants to reproduce the analysis will not have impacts associated to the computational capacity.

This is a final bootcamp work, implemented in pairs. Renan([@renanbdr](https://github.com/renanbdr)) and I worked together. 
The scope of the work was, in a 2-week period, to generate a differentiated experimental recommender system using a public dataset and at least 3 algorithms.
